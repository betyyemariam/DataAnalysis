# Medical appointments data analysis
## Introduction

This dataset collects information
from 100k medical appointments in
Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up
for their appointment. A number of
characteristics about the patient are
included in each row.


## Research Questions
1. Visualize the distribution of genders among patients who showed up and those who didn't?
2. Compare the age distribution for patients who showed up and those who didn't?
3. Explore the impact of enrollment in the Bolsa Fam√≠lia welfare program on appointment attendance?
4. Calculate the overall percentage of appointments where SMS reminders were received and visualize the difference in attendance rates between appointments with and without SMS reminders?
